The Lorenz Attractor

$dxdt=σ(y−x)$
dtdx​=σ(y−x)

dydt=x(1−z)−y
dtdy​=x(1−z)−y

dzdt=xy−bz
dtdz​=xy−bz

This set of equations, known as the Lorenz attractor, is a classic example of a chaotic system. The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations that describe the motion of fluids.
